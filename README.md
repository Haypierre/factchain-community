# truemint-community
Decentralized notes, decentralized rewards. A collaborative approach to combating misinformation, block by block.

Contributors to Truemint Community can record notes about any social media post on the blockchain. If enough contributors from different viewpoints rate a note as helpful on the blockchain, the note will be displayed on truemint.tech, and on the Truemint browser extension.

- Notes & votes are permissionless. No central authority to trust.
- Transparent incentives for note writers & voters. Truemint rewards writers who create helpful notes & voters who identify helpful/misleading notes
- Truemint's truth layer works for any social media platform:
  - Truemint's browser extension adds Truemint notes on top of social media posts
  - Anyone can query the Truemint API for notes on social media posts
